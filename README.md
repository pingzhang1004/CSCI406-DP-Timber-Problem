# CSCI406-DP-Timber-Problem

### Implement a dynamic programming algorithm to compute the maximum sum of lengths of wood that can be achieved by strategically picking each turn.

#### 1. Implemented a recursive algorithm to solve the Timber problem.
#### 2.  Implemented a dynamic programming algorithm to solve the Timber problem.
#### 3. Implemented a traceback step that identifies the order in which the segments are taken within the dynamic programming algorithm.
#### 4. Compared the Runtime of the recursive algorithm and dynamic programming algorithm, and analyed Algorithms Complexity
